# chromecast-batch-conversion-script

Batch conversion script for Chromecast, originally by StevenTrux, modified by outlyer

The Purpose of this Script is to batch convert any video file to mp4 or mkv format for chromecast compatibility
this script only convert necessary tracks if the video is already
in H.264 format it won't convert it saving your time!

Put all video files need to be converted in a folder!

Usage:

    tochromecast.sh mp4 /home/user/divx /home/user/chromecastvideos
or

    tochromecast.sh mkv /home/user/divx /home/user/chromecastvideos
